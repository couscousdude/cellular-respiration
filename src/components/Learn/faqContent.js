        question: 'What is Cellular Respiration?',
        answer: 'Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from oxygen molecules or nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What are ATP molecules?',
        answer: 'ATP molecules (aka adenosine triphosphate) are molecules that store energy inside cells. ATP is a nucleotide that consists of an adenine base, attached to a ribose sugar, that is attached to 3 phosphate groups.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What are the Waste Products of Cellular Respiration?',
        answer: 'Cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide, or CO2 as a waste product'
    },
    {
        question: 'Where does Cellular Respiration Begin?',
        answer: 'Cellular respiration begins in the cytoplasm of cells, but most of the reactions actually occur inside the mitochondria, which has been dubbed \"The Powerhouse of the Cell\"'
    },
    {
        question: 'Where are the mitochondria?',
        answer: 'The mitochondria are located within the fluid that surrounds the nucleus, the cytoplasm.'
    },
    {
        'question': 'What is the Equation for Cellular Respiration?',
        answer: 'The equation for cellular respiration is C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O.'
